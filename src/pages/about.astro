        <p>
          I'm James Reagan, a software engineer in Hawai&#699;i focused on
          artificial intelligence. My path to the technology industry has been
          unconventional, having previously served in the United States Marine
          Corps and worked as an archaeologist for a decade.
        </p>
        <p>
          My technical journey began though in the 1990s with Unix systems and C
          programming as a hobby. Today, I work primarily with AI at the
          application layer, with research interests more broadly in large
          language models and the theoretical foundations of machine learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm passionate about building AI applications, open source
          development, technical writing, and mentoring. Outside of tech, I
          practice hula and study Hawaiian language, which meaningfully connects
          me to community here.
        </p>
        <p>
          I live on Hawai&#699;i Island with my wife, where we've found a
          balance between modern technology and traditional culture. When not
          coding, you might find me practicing hula, gardening, traveling, or
          learning something new.
