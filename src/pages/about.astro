          Welcome to my technical blog! I'm James Reagan, a software engineer in
          Hawai&#699;i focused on artificial intelligence. My path to the
          technology industry has been unconventional, having previously served
          in the United States Marine Corps and also worked as an archaeologist
          for about a decade.
        </p>

          My technical journey began though in the 1990s with Unix systems and C
          programming as a hobby. Today, I work primarily with AI at the
          application layer, with research interests more broadly in large
          language models and the theoretical foundations of machine learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm passionate about building AI applications, open source
          development, technical writing, and mentoring. Outside of tech, I
          practice hula and study Hawaiian language, which meaningfully connects
          me to community here. Culture, community, sense of place, and
          connection to nature are important to me.
        </p>

          I live on Hawai&#699;i Island with my wife, where we've found a
          balance between modern technology and traditional culture. When I'm
          not coding, you might find me at hula practice, tending to our garden,
          reading in a cozy spot, exploring new places, or learning something
          new.
